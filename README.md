# SES Database Project

This coursework builds a **database system** for *Stellar Education Solutions (SES)* — a company that manages students, staff, courses, and branches.

The project includes:

* An **ERD** showing how all tables connect
* **SQL code** to create and fill the database
* **Queries** to get useful information (like payments, performance, and course details)
* **Security roles** for managers and tutors
* **Optimisation** to make the database faster

It was done by **Group 24** — Augustine, Oliver, and Abdelrhman — for the **Database Systems Development (M21269)** module at the **University of Portsmouth**.
